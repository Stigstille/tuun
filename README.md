# Tuun

## Info
Tuun is my music player. Compatibility isn't really a goal, but it should work
on most Linux distros with some finagling. This is its fifth iteration,
featuring async!

**Incomplete List of Dependencies**
- mpv -> Required. Used to play and control music and display album art.
- fzf -> Recommended. Necessary if you want to be able to queue songs with
q.sh.
- alacritty -> Recommended. You can use whatever terminal you like, but you'll
have to edit the shell scripts. Necessary for queueing with q.sh.

## Usage
Run run.sh or q.sh. Feel free to add wm-level keybinds for these.
