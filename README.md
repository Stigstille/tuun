# Tuun

## Info
Tuun is my music player. It is currently not intended to be compatible with
systems that are not mine. This is its fifth iteration, featuring async!

**Incomplete List of Dependencies**
- mpv -> Required. Used to play and control music and display album art.
- fzf -> Recommended. Necessary if you want to be able to queue songs with
q.sh.
- alacritty -> Recommended. You can use whatever terminal you like, but you'll
have to edit the shell scripts.

## Usage
Run run.sh or q.sh. Feel free to add wm-level keybinds for these.
